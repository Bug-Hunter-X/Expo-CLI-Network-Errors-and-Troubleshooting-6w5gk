# Expo CLI Network Errors

This repository demonstrates a common problem encountered when using the Expo CLI: network errors that prevent project building, starting, or updates.

The `expoBug.js` file simulates a situation where network communication is hindered (for demonstration purposes).  `expoBugSolution.js` provides methods to debug and resolve such issues.  This includes checking network connectivity, verifying proxy settings, and handling potential server outages.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure your device is properly connected to the internet. Try accessing other websites to rule out general network problems.
2. **Verify Proxy Settings:** If you're behind a proxy server, correctly configure the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables.  Expo might need these to communicate with its servers.
3. **Check Firewalls:** Firewalls on your device or network could be blocking Expo's outgoing connections.  Temporarily disable them (if possible and safe) to see if that resolves the issue.  If a firewall is the cause, you'll need to configure it to allow Expo's necessary traffic.
4. **Expo Server Status:** Check the Expo status page to see if there's a known outage or issue.  If so, you'll need to wait until the service is restored.
5. **Restart:** A simple restart of your computer and the Expo CLI might resolve temporary glitches.
6. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning and rebuilding your Expo project: `expo prebuild --clean`, followed by `expo start`.
7. **Update Expo CLI:** Make sure you're running the latest version of the Expo CLI using `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`.
8. **Review Expo documentation:** For more in-depth guidance, refer to the official Expo documentation on troubleshooting network issues.
