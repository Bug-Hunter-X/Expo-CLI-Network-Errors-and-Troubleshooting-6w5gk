The solution involves careful examination of network settings, server status, and environment variables.

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
// This is a conceptual outline; specific implementation would involve your system's commands.

// Check network connectivity (implementation is system-dependent)
const isNetworkConnected = checkNetworkConnection(); // Replace with your network check
if (!isNetworkConnected) {
  console.error('Network connectivity is unavailable. Please check your network connection.');
  return;
}

//Check Proxy Settings (implementation is system-dependent; usually involves env vars)
const proxySettings = getProxySettings();
if(proxySettings.invalid) {
  console.error('Proxy settings appear to be misconfigured. Please check and correct your proxy settings.');
  return;
}

//Check Expo server status (implementation may involve API calls to Expo's status page)
const expoServerStatus = checkExpoServerStatus();
if(expoServerStatus.error) {
  console.error('Expo servers are currently experiencing issues. Please check the status page for updates.');
  return;
}

//If all checks pass then proceed with Expo command
//console.log('Network checks passed');
expoStart(); // Or any Expo CLI command you were having trouble with
